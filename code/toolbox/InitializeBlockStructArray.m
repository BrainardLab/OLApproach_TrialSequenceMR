function block = InitializeBlockStructArray(protocolParams,pulseParams,modulationsCellArray)
% InitializeBlockStructArray  Sets up block data structure for each trial, including attention task info
%
% Usage:
%     block = InitializeBlockStructArray(protocolParams,modulationData)
%
% Description:
%     The block structure contains trial-by-trial information about the experiemnt such as 
%     start/stops values.  One of the key jobs of this routine is (optionally) to 
%     modify the starts/stops values to include an attention task stimulus, which is a 
%     dimming of the full field.
%
%     It is possible that the attention task code should be yet further factorized into
%     its own separate function.
%     
% Input:
%     protocolParams (struct)            A struct that contain the starts/stops.  Some key fields:
%                                        attentionTask - If true insert attention task.
%                                        [DHB NOTE: IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW ABOUT MORE KEY FIELDS HERE.]                
%
% Output:
%     block (struct)                     Contains trial-by-trial starts/stops and other info. 
%
% Optional key/value pairs.
%    None.
